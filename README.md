#sauron

Sauron is a graph data ingestion tool that currently includes a bit of reddit. This was hacked together pretty quickly, so don't be surprised if it kinda sucks/makes your beard catch fire. No guarantees about anything. In fact, you probably shouldn't even use this.

## Installation

1. Set up a neo4j server
2. `npm install`
3. Edit `src/config/config.json`
4. `node sauron.js`

## Known issues

* Everything
* The UI mixed with console output is glitchy and sucks
* Resource leakage or other tomfoolery requiring exits after doing a lot of shit
* Most things could probably be done better

## Interesting queries

TODO/try harder ;)
